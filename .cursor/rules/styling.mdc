# Styling Conventions

## Formatting
- Prettier is the single source of truth for formatting.
- Do not add ESLint rules that conflict with Prettier.
- Run `pnpm format` to fix formatting issues.

## CSS
- Use plain CSS files (existing pattern).
- Prefer CSS custom properties (variables) for theming values.
- Use semantic class names that describe purpose, not appearance.

## Code Comments
- Do not add comments that narrate what the code does.
- Only add comments for non-obvious intent, trade-offs, or constraints.
- Use JSDoc for public utility function documentation.
