# General Coding Conventions

## TypeScript
- Use TypeScript strict mode. Never use `any` -- prefer `unknown` with type narrowing.
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Use named exports, not default exports.
- Use early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting.
- Define interfaces for all component props and function parameters.

## Code Style
- Prettier handles all formatting -- do not override or fight Prettier.
- Use double quotes for strings (project convention).
- Semicolons are required.
- 2-space indentation.

## Git
- All commits must follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `perf:`, `ci:`.
- Keep commits small and focused on a single change.

## Dependencies
- Use `date-fns` for date manipulation (already in use).
- Use `zod` for all runtime validation and schemas.
- Use `react-hook-form` with `@hookform/resolvers` for forms.

## File Organization
- Source code in `src/`.
- Components in `src/components/` (PascalCase filenames).
- Hooks in `src/hooks/` (camelCase, prefixed with `use`).
- Utility functions in `src/utils/`.
- State management in `src/store/`.
- Validation schemas in `src/schemas/`.
