# React Conventions

## Components
- Use functional components only. No class components.
- Define prop types with TypeScript interfaces (not `type` aliases for props).
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks in `src/hooks/`.

## State Management
- Use Recoil atoms for global state (existing pattern in `src/store/atoms.ts`).
- Use `useState` for local UI state.
- Use `react-hook-form` with Zod resolvers for form state.

## Patterns
- Prefer composition over prop drilling.
- Handle loading and error states explicitly.
- Use early returns for conditional rendering.

## Performance
- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`.
- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed as props.
- Avoid creating objects or arrays inline in JSX props.
